# Work Summary for MDP 

[TOC]

I started to join the MDP team in Umich to work Professor Carol Flannagan and Dr Kathy Klinch since 2021 winter and belle

## WINTER 2021

In 2021 winter, I work in the process team, and I mainly did following things (At first I don't know to fill the updates in google form due to VPN connection issues (cannot be submitted) so some of my updates were sent by email)

- Examine possible eye gaze software that can be used for our project, and the result is shown in:

- Compare different coder' result of heat map, by fixing the matlab code before to work with new version, and the matlab code is updated

  Result list:

- Code two videos, the results in google drive, with Metric version 5.

- Write codes to generate the confusion matrix to analyze 5 users' label with all metrics, sample confusion matrix as follow. Codes updated in google drive.

- Implement codes to processing raw images:

## SUMMER 2021

- In May, follow up the neural network training, finish the CNN model testing

- As tech team requires people, went to tech team to work on the Yolo Res Net data clean up. Including ploting histos, doing calculations of the distance betwen the the near frame and do the comparison. Some results are in the repo

  

## FALL 2021

- Revise the Algorithm to work on shaky ground truth, and solve the problem of the accuracy
- Implement the base, duplicate and probability model, some results of ML are shown in the shared slides
- Install the software on the remote computer, test Pygaze, Ogama & GazeRecorder
- Write paper (in progress)
- Read paper of dealing uncertainties in ML, including the confident learning, the ensemble method (with different model), randomness.
